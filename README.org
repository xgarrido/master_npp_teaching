#+TITLE: Nuclear & Particle Physics classes of Master 1 - README

* Introduction

This repository contains materials for Nuclear & Particle Physics classes given
in Master 1 of Fundamental Physics at the University of Paris Sud.

* Installation

You will need special =orgmode= settings to translate the =org= files into =pdf=
documents. All the needed code is embedded within this file in the next
sections. Nevertheless, you will need to install some [[https://github.com/xgarrido/latex-templates][latex-templates]] specially
developed for such purpose.

Moreover, to avoid duplication of =org-mode= LaTeX class, [[https://github.com/xgarrido/zsh-org-pages][org-pages]] script is
used to produce =pdf= file as well as =html= (if needed). It adds another
dependency but it eases the unification of org export for several file sources.

There is no need to detangle this file since emacs will do it when you
will use the Makefile in the corresponding directories. So, next step will be to
do =make= within the different directories.
